Read the barcode-overview.pdf for more details how the plugin works and how to print from the browsers.

These are the 4 current browsers that currently support/display this plugin correctly and print out the barcodes:

1. FireFox (Current Version: 63.0.3 and up)
2. Chrome (Current Version: 70.0.3 and up)
3. Opera (Current Version: 56.0.3 and up)
4. Microsoft Edge (Current Version: 42.17 and up)

The Barcode Letter-Size plugin can display 48 - 60 barcodes per print page (depending on the browser you are using).

Once the sheet is print out, you can used a scissor to cut out the barcodes.

I recommended that you delete the barcode(s) once you print the ones you wanted so you save space on your website.
